 * <li>Once an onComplete or onError are performed, no further calls can be executed</li>

     * Intrinsic synchronized locking with double-check short-circuiting was chosen after testing several other implementations.
     * 
     * The code and results can be found here:
     * - https://github.com/benjchristensen/JavaLockPerformanceTests/tree/master/results/Observer
     * - https://github.com/benjchristensen/JavaLockPerformanceTests/tree/master/src/com/benjchristensen/performance/locks/Observer
     * 
     * The major characteristic that made me choose synchronized instead of Reentrant or a customer AbstractQueueSynchronizer implementation
     * is that intrinsic locking performed better when nested, and AtomicObserver will end up nested most of the time since Rx is
     * compositional by its very nature.
